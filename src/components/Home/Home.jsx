			<p> Game consists in clearing all the squares of the board that don't have a mine.
				<br/><br/>
				Some squares have a number, this number indicates the mines around it. If a square has the number 3, it means that of the eight squares around it (if it isn't in a corner or edge) there are 3 mines and 5 without mines. If a square is found without a number, it indicates that none of the surrounding squares has a mine, empty squares are discovered automatically.
				<br/><br/>
				If a square with mine is discovered, the game is lost.
